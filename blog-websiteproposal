<h1> Building a Website for a Landscaping Company </h1>

<p> I come from a family of landscapers that usually work one on one with other customers. However, because many businesses operate in the 
digital space, I thought it would be cool to design a website for my family’s business for one of my class projects. </p>


<br>

<h3> The Idea</h3>
<p>In this class we explored the evolution of websites by using tools such as the Wayback Machine. Using this tool, as a class we analyzed 
what were some of the features that worked, why some didn’t, and what we would do to improve them. All of those lessons transferred to my 
final project where I knew that I wanted to create a site that focused on simplicity. The demographics of this company are usually 20-65 
years old. Thus, many would want a site that was easy to access thought. </p>

<br>

<h3> New Customers</h3>
<p> For new customers I wanted people to get attracted to the business by having sample work displayed as soon as they arrived at the 
website. That is why in my home page, under the tabs, you would find an image of the company’s team photo and explain what the company 
does and what are some of their core philosophies. As you scroll down there is a section where you can read more detail about certain 
types of work if you clicked on the gallery which would take you to images taken form previous jobs relating that type of work. 
Additionally, if they had questions just bellow that, there is a section simply designed of information of how to contact the company.</p>

<br>

<p>For more detail, if you clicked on the Services Offered tab it would take you to a gallery where you can find more information about 
that type of work and what are some of the specific services the company can do. Similarly, a Gallery showing before and after is critical 
to have in this website because new customers want to see what kind of work the company has done before. This is crucial because if people 
did not have images, then it would make them skeptical about whether or not they should hire this company. Many of the current customers 
became customers because other people recommended the company, thus it would be nice to expand the pool of how the company gets its 
customers by having captivating images that grab the attention of various new people.</p>

<br>

<h3> New Customers</h3>

<p>All of the information above is nice to have for everybody, but this company does have long standing customers who are vey familiar with 
their work and just need somewhere to contact them when they request new work to be done or need to pay. For this I included two buttons 
next to the banner logo one that says “Request an Estimate” and “Make a payment”. These buttons then take the customer to either a pop up 
that asks for the details of the project or ways to make payments, respectively. </p> 

<br>

<p>Finally, lets say a customer has a question that has not been answered and need a way to contact the company. In the Contact tab, the 
customer can find information of how to contact the company (phone or email) or fill out message inquiry that the company will receive 
with the customer’s information and follow up – this option will be useful for new or existing clients.</p>
<br>


<h3> Presentation</h3>
<p>While this website was not developed to fruition. Below you can find a presentation with the website proposal where you can find my 
thinking process, design inspiration, and flowcharts/wireframes.</p>
<br>
<p>Thinking through this plan was really interesting and challenging at times. I had a lot of fun organizing the flowchart, working through 
wireframes, and analyzing client’s needs. Having worked in this family business, I know the kinds of questions people always have, what kind 
of services they need the most, and what kind of contact they need with the company. Thus, it was worthwhile to imagine what this business 
would look like in the digital space rather than the traditional route which happens face to face.</p>
