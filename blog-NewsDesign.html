<h1> Newspaper Design </h1>
<p>In a semester long-project, my task was to create a newspaper catered to the Chicago audience. With the decline of newspapers, my 
task was to create something that would attract people back to this medium. I came up with The Chicago Pulse which is a newspaper that 
target the younger audience with a design philosophy of delivering news in a ways that it was simple, graphic focused, and right to the 
point. Even though usability heuristics is mainly used for digital design work, I used the same concepts to apply it to this medium 
because it is important to create a product that is accessible and effective no matter what medium it consists of. Through the 
semester I had to create various sections that required me to use different tools in my design toolbox.</p>


<h3> First A-1  </h3> 
<p>This is the first assignment for the newspaper which was to create a A-1 page that would appear in the front page of the newspaper. 
There were many ideas I had to tackle to accomplish my goal of making a new and innovative product for the younger audience. Among 
finding things for inspiration regarding to how I should design the A-1 page, I decide to experiment and see how I interacted with news. 
I deduced that news that brought me more attention where headlines that did not have a lot of text and had images. Thus, my 
approach to an A-1 page (where the most important news where located) was to provide teaser-like boxes that had images and 
right to the point text. Important news where bigger in size, and I wanted the typography to follow a more modernized look.</p>

<h3>Features Section</h3>
<p>The second assignment was to gather the tools learned from the previous A-1 assignment and focus more on one section. One of the 
sections on The Chicago Pulse was a features section on entertainment. This was a really fun section to make because I was able to 
expand my creativity by designing each news story (comedy/radio, movies, music) differently. The main story displayed talked about 
a podcast that talked about the South Side of Chicago and celebrated the neighborhood with comedy through stories. This was my first 
time working with Photoshop to create cutouts, and I used that knowledge to make a cutout to celebrate the hosts of this podcast. 
In the article, there was also a Q and A section, and I took advantage of that to design that section in a unique way by using drop 
caps and the color red consistent with the newspaper.</p>

<br

<p>I also used a cutout for the second story and while it was fun, it was a challenge to find where to place this image and how big I 
should make the cutout. I did not want to make the image so big that it would distract from the main story, but not so small that the 
image would lose its meaning. The width of the image also made it difficult to position it because it left very little space to add text. 
But I was able to compliment the image and text by making the image of medium size and adding text that would be enough to hook readers 
to follow up with the story.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p> A different but related issue I had while making this features section was how to design the header for the section. This was the first 
time I had to design the header – as I did not do it previously. There were many ideas I designed. I was looking for a header that 
accomplished that modern look but also looked good alongside teasers that are necessary in newspapers. This required me to play with 
typography, fonts, and art design. The final design logos where created and tested with the other sections to make sure the design was 
consistent, and it played well with the length of the other section’s names.</p>

<h3>Tabloids </h3>
<p>In the next project the challenge was to create a tabloid version of the newspaper. This required me to distinguish traditional 
newspapers and tabloids and what strategies are more beneficial for tabloids. In addition to this challenge, the story had to be related to 
climate change. This design required even more design creativity and strategies. I created four different versions before arriving to the 
final version.</p>
<br>

<p>In this first version, I focused on an article in which The Guardian was taking new steps to accurately talk about the urgency of climate
 change. The art design featured a reporter’s silhouette with the image of a climate march as the reporter’s body area. A fun and creative 
 idea I designed related to the story was to design the headline “TRUTH” as an acronym. The reason for this was that “truth” was a word 
 important for The Guardian and each initial would be another word mentioned in the article.</p>

</div>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>The second version focused on a story more local story to my primary audience – Chicago. This story talked about how the heavy rains in 
 Illinois in Spring 2019 affected farmer’s harvest in the state. I wanted to create an interesting primary art design that captured the 
 attention of the reader. I came up with a dramatic cutout of a corn stalk (one of the main crops affected) that is submerged underwater. 
 This would intrigue the readers to ask themselves why such a dramatic image and what was the story behind that.</p>

</div>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>For the third design, I wanted to focus more on typography and have the words speak for story. Thus, I designed the headline “Heavy Rains
 Ruin Crops” to explain how crushing the heavy rains had on the crops. The first part “Heavy” was then crushing “Ruin Crops” which is in a 
 much smaller size. To illustrate this symbolism, I then made the word “HEAVY” have a rain drop in the letter “V”.</p>

</div>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>The final version featured this design, but I got rid of the other additional rain drops that did not really made sense with the design. I also 
 corrected the color of the typography to be more colorful and not so dull. Finally, the tabloid’s logo was completely re-designed to match 
 the goal of making this tabloid focused on climate change.</p>

<h3>Photo Spread</h3>
<p>In another project, I had to do something completely different which was to create a photo essay that spanned both pages of the newspaper 
or a spread. This required me to think about the images, the purpose of said images, location, and relevance of the images to the story. I 
could have done an essay about any particular place in the world that my audience could visit and tour. But I decided to focus on Chicago 
and draw attention to food places in Chicago that would be good to visit especially during the holiday season (Halloween, Thanksgiving, and 
Christmas). My approach to this was to do something different than the traditional images of different sizes dispersed on the spread. I 
wanted to incorporate something known in Chicago into the design. What I mean by this is that a lot of people associate Chicago and 
traveling in it like a compass (North Chicago, West Chicago, South Side, etc.). </p>

<br>

<p>So, I did exactly that and looked for places in the south, west, north, and the loop (in place of the east side because Chicago’s east 
side is Lake Michigan). Once I found the places and their images that I wanted to feature, I turned the designed like a compass and wrote 
a small paragraph about why this place would be great to visit for the holidays. This could benefit both tourist and Chicago natives who 
have never been to those places.</p>

<br>

<p>While people liked my idea because it was clever and creative, I did have a hard time implementing the compass design because I did not 
know if I should make the design like four quadrants or make it strictly like a compass. The problem with making the images four quadrants 
was that I did not know where I should place the text as you can see here. I could also stick to the traditional compass, but it would leave 
a lot of white space and nothing to compliment it:</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>I finally made something work in the end. The final design achieved the compass look that I wanted and, by making the top images 
panoramas, the white space disappeared. Overall, I was very happy with the final result!</p>

<h3> Sports </h3>
<p>I also designed a sports A-1 section with focus on stats and images of information regarding a player, game, or sport related story. This 
was the most challenging designed for me because I know nothing or follow sports at all. Thus, it was very difficult finding a story that I 
wanted to design for if I did not really understand the content. It was very difficult for me to understand the vocabulary in sports and 
what was relevant when it came to scores, players, or events. I had to study a lot on the basic of sports before even starting the design.</p>

<br>

<p>Once I figured the stories I wanted to talk about, I started to plan my design. The stories where going to be about local Chicago teams 
in three different sports – soccer, hockey, and football. The main story was going to be about a woman in sports and her great achievements. 
The football story was going to be a teaser and the hockey story featured a game with the Black Hawks. There where many ideas when it came 
to designing a highlight of the female player – Sam Kerr. I played around with different cutouts of the player and positioning of the stats’ 
graphics: </p>

<br>

<p>I was very proud of the final result because the cutout looked great, I had a ton of fun making and designing the graphics, and the design
 of the section’s logo was something creative that worked for the page.</p>

<h3>National News</h3>
<p>For the final project, I had to create a national news A-1 and spread about an important news story. I chose a story that, at the time, 
impacted the nation as well as my main audience – Chicagoans. Thus, I chose to do in on an important political event.  There were many 
design choices that I had to think through, but my main issues where condensing information and placement of information. I had those two 
issues because the story had a lot of information so I did not have a clear idea of how reduced that down, the reader did not have a clear 
idea of where to start reading, where to read next, or would be so overwhelmed by text that he/she would not even attempt to read.</p>

<br>

<p> To tackle the issue of massive text, was to transform/replace the text into graphics (quotes, timelines, and bio boxes). I did so by 
laying out only text that was really important to read rather than to see in a summarized form. If the news of that subtitle had more 
information with quotes or dates, instead of having that info word for word, I designed graphics that provided the same information in 
a more simple and eye-catching way. That way the reader got the information quickly, right-to the point, and in a way where the reader 
could easily see it. All information of a story is important of course, so in order to compensate for the reduction of news, I included 
a website link to let readers know that they could find more detailed information in another medium without constraints of space. This 
helped me reduce so much space and encouraged my readers to feel more encouraged about reading a heavy-news story.</p>

<br>

<p>To fix the issue of information placement, I had to think a lot of how people would approach my spread, where they were going to look 
first, and how their eyes navigated from section to section. With the help of classmates, I was able to understand how people interacted 
with my product, why they looked at a certain section that they were not meant to look at next, and what was their thinking process when 
they read my news. The ability to experience real live people working through my newspaper gave me such a great insight in finding solutions 
so that people would follow the logical order of reading my news. Thus, I experimented around a lot with typography colors, type, and fonts 
to differentiate from subheadings, headings, and main titles. For example, I created a banner with special graphics that occupied the whole 
top space of the spread so that the reader understood where the main tittle was, where the heading started, and which heading to go to next.</p>

<br>

<p>All of these changes proved to be successful because at the end people where not so overwhelmed by information, everything followed a 
logical way of reading things, and it was visually appealing, so people read information quickly and where informed.</p>
