<h1> Newspaper Design </h1>
<p>In a semester long-project, my task was to create a newspaper catered to the Chicago audience. With the decline of newspapers, my 
task was to create something that would attract people back to this medium. I came up with The Chicago Pulse which is a newspaper that 
target the younger audience with a design philosophy of delivering news in a ways that it was simple, graphic focused, and right to the 
point. Even though usability heuristics is mainly used for digital design work, I used the same concepts to apply it to this medium 
because it is important to create a product that is accessible and effective no matter what medium it consists of. Through the 
semester I had to create various sections that required me to use different tools in my design toolbox.</p>
