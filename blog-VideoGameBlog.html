<h1> COMM 205 - Communication and New Media </h1>

<p> During COMM 205, I learned about all sorts of information that had to do with communication studies and new media. For example, I learned about 
the history of evolving media technology, the rise of web 2.0, and the social justice side of digital media like e-waste. </p>


<br>

<h3> The Blog </h3>
<p>For a final project, the class was tasked to do a blog about a topic that we liked or were passionate about. We were then asked to design and produce 
content for that blog using the website builder Wix.com. </p>

<br>

<p> One of my favorite hobbies is, of course, videogames, so I took the opportunity to build a blog where I could talk, analyze, and review videogames.</p>
<p> Check out my website live <a href="https://pmolina16.wixsite.com/polarbeargaminghub" target="_blank"> here</a>!</p>

<br>

<p>This was one of my very first experience with design during my early college years. I was very excited to design even the smallest of details, and I spent 
a lot of time thinking about the theme, finding the right pictures, experimenting with organization of content, and writing blogs that were informative but 
fun to read. At the end, I was very proud of the design work I accomplished because I felt like I captured the aesthetic and feel or a videogame blog. I 
had a lot of fun designing and creating this blog!</p>
