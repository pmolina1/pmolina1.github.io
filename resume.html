 <div class="description">
	<h3> The Social and Interactive Media Lab (SIMLab) at Loyola University Chicago </h3>
	<h4> Intern </h4>
	<p>During my internship, I composed research and data driven blogs that shined light on topics related to digital media and 
	communication in hopes of raising awareness of social justice issues. Some examples of blogs I composed talked about video 
	games and how some titles are worth playing because they express social advocacy like LGBTQ rights and immigration, how video 
	games are not causing violence using data and information from experts,  and how tech industries need to be aware of ongoing 
	issues that hurt women and how they can accommodate their spaces to welcome more women and make them feel safe. Together with 
	my advisor, I learned more about arranging/analyzing data, thought about my audience for the blogs and edited them accordingly, 
	and gained an understanding of diverse social and technology related topics.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I also designed fliers to promote upcoming research talk events from speakers who have conducted research in the field. Additionally, 
	I helped organize such events by marketing the event, organizing the venue, and producing Facebook Live footage for non-attending audiences.</p>

	<h3> Girls Who Code (STEM + Arts and Humanities) – STEAHM Fellowship Program </h3>
	<h4> Fellow </h4>
	<p>I currently work in this fellowship program that aims to teach young girls (6th to 12th grade) about coding. I teach basic concepts for example, 
	python fundamentals like conditionals and loops as well as coding languages like CSS and HTML. In this program we connected arts and humanities with 
	technology and science. We used both disciplinaries to create projects that spoke to social causes. One example is that we had the girls create websites 
	using HTML/CSS to express advocacy for social issues like body positivity, climate change, and humane treatment of animals.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As a fellow, I was involved in administrative roles like building curriculums/lesson plans, teaching class to students, and creating reports based on 
	how class was going. Additionally, I also coordinated with other fellows to compose emails to parents and students, keep an updated attendance record, 
	and recruited students.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I also shared my experiences about being a woman in STEM. I explained to the girls about my journey of learning how to code, what the environment is 
	like, and how to deal with emotional obstacles that they may feel like the Imposter syndrome. Together with other female fellows and volunteers, we talked 
	about empowerment and supported these young girls to be the leaders of technology.</p>

	<h3> Girls Who Code Loyola Chapter </h3>
	<h4> Volunteer and Mentor </h4>
	<p>Growing up having an interest in technology, there were not female role models or even resources that could teach me how to code. When entering college,
	I was one of the few female students in my coding classes and, at times, it was overwhelming. However, I persevered though and gained knowledge in multiple
	coding languages. My passion since then has been to help young girls who also have the same interest not be discouraged by obstacles that they may face. 
	Whether it means not having mentors to look up to or have the coding classes needed, it is important for young girls to have the opportunity and resources 
	to obtain this valuable skill.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As a volunteer at Loyola’s Girls Who Code program, I helped young girls from 6th to 12th grade learn how to build their own websites using HTML, CSS, 
	JavaScript, and Python. Additionally, I taught these young girls the power of coding, the numerous projects they can accomplish with said skills, the 
	importance of communication and teamwork, and most importantly, encourage them to become leaders in the tech industry.</p>

	<h3> Miguel Landscaping </h3>
	<h4> Company Secretary </h4>
	<p>I worked in this family business as the secretary and organizer. During this time, I was tasked with a variety of activities to help the business 
	organize schedules and interact with customers. Some of those activities included: answering phone calls/text messages, issuing appointments and meetings 
	with customers, and organizing daily routes based on appointments.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As the secretary, I was in constant communication with costumers, and I directed them with the right resources or help they needed. I did so by resolving/clarifying contracts, 
	answering all of their questions/issues they might have had, and reporting back to the landscapers about their landscaping plans/needs.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I also participated in the design and organizing process of gardens. Together with the landscapers and the customer, we engaged in conversations about 
	how to plan the design of how gardens should look and if the design made sense given the space.</p>

	<h4> Member  </h4>
	<p>I was a member of this club in Arrupe College that advocated for the rights of undocumented people, in particular, students. I helped plan events, 
	mainly, the Arrupe Walk which was organized to support undocumented students in Illinois to be able to apply for scholarships in 4-year public 
	universities. Additionally, I assisted in the creation of the DASO logo and developed fliers to spread the word about events.</p>
