<p> Since I was a young girl, I was always surrounded by technology. Whether it was painting in MS paint, 
watching YouTube videos, playing games, or simply helping family members with technological issues. 
Thus, I knew that for a future career I wanted to work with anything that had to do with the digital 
world. In high school, there were no programs to help me learn how to code nor did I had teachers 
that could have been mentors to teach me. But, I still had a passion with working with tech. It was 
not until college, that I was given the opportunity to explore my career interests further.
<br>
<br>
I attended Arrupe College of Loyola University from 2015-2017 – a two-year college program that helped 
first generation and low-income students afford a college education. During my time, I gained a variety 
of knowledge in diverse disciplinaries: ethics, environmental science, politics, communication, and 
many more. I graduated in 2017 with a A.A in Liberal Arts. I transferred to Loyola University in 2017 
with hopes that I could learn more about coding. I learned languages like Python and Java. Additionally, 
I am involved with the organization Girls Who Code in which I mentor students about being a woman in 
tech, support them in their journey through STEM, and teach them how to code! I was also given the 
opportunity to learn CSS/HTML thanks to this organization. In 2018, I changed my major to Digital Media 
with a Computer Science minor and focused on web design and development; I will graduate in December 2019. 
My dream is to work in UX/UI design job and continue to provide my best design planning skills and customer 
service experience to clients. </p>

<h2> Personally</h2>

<div class="per-flex">


<p> I am a quiet, soft-spoken person, but I can be more dynamic once you get to know me! Some of the things 
I enjoy in my free time are watching Youtube, laughing at memes, listening to music, playing video games, and hugging my dogs.
<br>
<br>
I am a curious mind and I love to learn new things about the world through documentaries, watching news media, and keeping up with current events.
<br>
<br>
Gaming is very near to my heart, and even if it sounds odd, gaming was one of the influences that pushed me into 
design. <a href="./blog-zootycoon.html"> Click here to read a blog post on how that was possible</a>. But overall, I love gaming because I get to spend time with friends and have fun! 
<br>
<br>
Lastly, I cannot finish this without saying that I love my dogs! I am so lucky that I have two beautiful and huggable furry friends.

<h2> Philosophy </h2>

<div class="phi-flex">
<img src="media/digitalmedia.jpg" alt="Image displays a computer screen surrounded by icons like location globe, contact person, and smartphones"/>

<p> I am a very hard worker and I always deliver an assignment or project with more than 100% effort. I am always looking for 
learning opportunities, and if I do not know how to do a certain task, I surround myself with all the necessary tools to 
successfully learn a new skill. 
<br>
<br>
Part of the reason I am into design is because I love to observe the little details in projects, and always strive to make them look better. 
I constantly research for inspiration and never discard ideas that might be helpful in the future. While I do like making things pretty, 
I also am aware of ways my design ideas can be user friendly. I like putting myself in other people’s shoes and think of myself as the 
client interacting with my project. From there, I analyze things that can be improved and think of ideas that can help me deliver that improvement.
<br>
<br>
Teamwork is essential for me. I believe that working with many people with different experience, design, and development backgrounds can add diverse 
tools to our idea’s toolbox. I value everyone’s point of view and attention to detail. I cannot name how many times I have worked in projects 
where talking to teammates made the whole group come up with better ideas, learn from problems, create amazing projects, and become better 
designers/developers!
<br>
<br>
Lastly, having spend a lot of knowledge in social justice, ethics, communication, and critical thinking, I am observant of how technology interacts and 
impacts society. I think it is important to be informed about social issues that occur in STEM and digital industries. In my internship with Loyola’s 
Communication SIMLab, I blog and research a lot about how these disciplinaries cross paths. I hope to be socially conscious about how my future digital 
designs affect the population.
