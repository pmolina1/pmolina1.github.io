<h3> Website Re-Design</h3>
<p>My supervisor also wanted me to help her out with remaking the “About” section of the lab’s site. The website had an odd layout as you 
can observe in the before images. I approached this issue by doing research on how other websites usually designed an about page. I did a 
bunch of sketches, worked with the supervisor in outlining missions and design desires, and created wireframes and drafts for the supervisor 
to look over. The final product shows a much cleaner layout with the names of the current members and links to their bio with images. Below 
you will find alumni of the lab with links to their bios, work in the lab, and other outside projects they worked on.</p>
